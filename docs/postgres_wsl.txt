Install PostgreSQL

To install PostgreSQL on WSL (ie. Ubuntu):

    Open your WSL terminal (ie. Ubuntu).
    Update your Ubuntu packages: sudo apt update
    Once the packages have updated, install PostgreSQL (and the -contrib package which has some helpful utilities) with: sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
    Confirm installation and get the version number: psql --version

There are 3 commands you need to know once PostgreSQL is installed:

    sudo service postgresql status for checking the status of your database.
    sudo service postgresql start to start running your database.
    sudo service postgresql stop to stop running your database.

The default admin user, postgres, needs a password assigned in order to connect to a database. To set a password:

    Enter the command: sudo passwd postgres
    You will get a prompt to enter your new password.
    Close and reopen your terminal.

To run PostgreSQL with psql shell:

    Start your postgres service: sudo service postgresql start
    Connect to the postgres service and open the psql shell: sudo -u postgres psql
